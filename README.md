# angularjs-deckconf-tutorial
I've used AngularJS, Bootstrap and node.js to create an MVC app in which you can customize and update your MTG deck.
# Get stats from your deck! 
See your deck's mana curve, mana distribution and more, as well as the probability to draw each card by a given turn.
# AngularJS 
The goal of AngularJS is to bring the tools and capabilities that have been available only for
server-side development to the web client and, in doing so, make it easier to develop, test, and maintain rich and
complex web applications.
In this tutorial I'll show you how implement basic feature like function or directive and how use Bootstrap framework 
and how to make more elegant the app in a few small step.
# Node.js and MongoDB
In the second controller I've set up a simple "view" application using node.js to interface with mongodb local database to print out all the decks that are contained within thanks to a small drop-down menu.
